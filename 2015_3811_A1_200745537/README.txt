How to compile the C++ code using makefile in Terminal ? 

----------------------

1- Download the folder 2015_3811_A1_200745537.tgz and unzip it. The folder will contain a 9 source files ( README.txt, makefile, main.cpp, Matrix.cpp, Matrix.h, Point.cpp, Point.h, Vector.cpp and Vector.h )

2- Open Terminal - type cd to go to 2015_3811_A1_200745537 file directory. Then ls to check the files mentioned above. For example in my case : cd ~/Desktop/Graphics 2015_3811_A1_200745537

Then : ls

Makefile	Matrix.h	Point.h		Vector.h	README.txt
Matrix.cpp	Point.cpp	Vector.cpp	main.cpp

3- Now type Make, the g++ will do the job to compile the C++ code.

4- Finally, type in terminal: ./main to run the program. The results of the program will display in the terminal.
